# RAG_with_Langchain
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain" lab experience hosted via IBM SkillsBuild and IBM Cloud


## 🔍 Introduction
In the modern era of generative AI, language models such as GPT, BERT, and LLaMA have revolutionized natural language processing by generating human-like responses. However, these models are limited by the data they were trained on, leading to knowledge gaps, outdated information, or hallucinated outputs.

To overcome this, the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture was introduced — a hybrid approach that combines retrieval-based learning with generative models. This lab, offered via IBM SkillsBuild, provided a hands-on opportunity to build and explore a RAG-based pipeline using LangChain, a Python framework that simplifies working with LLM-powered applications.

## 🎯 Objective of the Lab
The goal of the "RAG with LangChain" lab was to:

Understand how RAG enhances LLMs with real-time information.

Build a functional RAG pipeline using LangChain.

Learn how to retrieve relevant knowledge from a dataset.

Augment user queries with contextual documents before generating responses.

Deploy and test the solution on Google Colab using IBM Cloud infrastructure.

## 📚 What is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)?
**➤ Definition:**
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a neural architecture that combines the power of information retrieval (like search engines) with the fluency of generative language models.

Instead of relying purely on the model's pre-trained knowledge, RAG introduces an external knowledge base (KB) or document store, from which relevant information is fetched and used as context for generating accurate, grounded responses.

## 🔁 RAG Workflow:
User Input (Query): A user submits a query or question.

Retrieval: The system searches a vector database or knowledge base to find semantically relevant documents using dense embeddings.

Augmentation: The retrieved documents are appended to the original query to enrich it with external factual context.

Generation: The LLM (e.g., GPT) processes the augmented query and generates a final, accurate, and context-aware response.

## 🛠️ LangChain & Its Role in RAG
LangChain is a Python framework that allows developers to build LLM-powered applications by integrating models, chains, and tools. In the context of RAG:

LangChain provides modules to handle:

Document loading

Text chunking

Embedding generation

Vector storage (like FAISS, Pinecone)

Retrieval mechanisms

Query augmentation

Model prompting and response generation

It acts as a middleware between data sources and large language models, allowing a modular, scalable, and maintainable approach to build RAG pipelines.

## ☁️ How IBM Cloud Supports This Lab
The lab was hosted on Google Colab but integrated with services and APIs from IBM Cloud. Here’s how IBM’s infrastructure enhanced the lab:

✅ Key IBM Cloud Integrations:
Watson AI Services: For deploying AI models and managing language-based APIs.

AutoAI & Machine Learning Pipelines: For advanced users to integrate RAG outputs into real-world ML workflows.

IBM Cloud Object Storage: Ideal for hosting and retrieving large document corpora used in retrieval stages.

IBM Watson Discovery (Advanced): A commercial-grade enterprise search engine that can be used in place of FAISS or open-source vector stores.

IBM Cloud ensures enterprise-grade security, reliability, and scalability, making it a go-to platform for deploying production-ready AI/RAG applications.

Vector Embedding:

A knowledge base is loaded and text is split into chunks.

These chunks are converted into dense vectors using embedding models.

Vector Store (Retrieval):

The vectors are stored in a vector database like FAISS.

Given a user query, relevant vectors (text chunks) are retrieved based on semantic similarity.

Augmentation & Generation:

Retrieved documents are fed along with the query into the language model (like OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.).

The LLM generates a well-informed answer using both its internal knowledge and the retrieved external context.

Testing & Evaluation:

Multiple queries are tested to analyze the responsiveness and factual correctness.

Edge cases and limitations are discussed.
